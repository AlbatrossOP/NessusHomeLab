<h1>Nessus Vulnurability Scan Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of using a virtual machine to simulate a vulnerable machine on a network, and utilizing Nessus Essentials to scan for vulnerabilities. Once these vulnerabilities are discovered, they can be remediated. In this instance, many initial vulnerabilities are linked to an outdated install of microsoft edge, and a lack of crucial windows updates on the virtual machine as this project was performed on a fresh install. Once updates have been installed, the number of vulnerabilities are reduced significantly.
